# 🧠 Chalo App: Technical Learning Log

## Current Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React.js (Component-based UI)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first design)
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 3 Flash (High-speed LLM)
- **Data Source:** Google Search Grounding (Live web data)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage (Device-level memory)

## Key Concepts Explained
1. **JSON (The Bridge):** Standard data interchange format.
2. **Grounding:** Connecting AI to live search data for accuracy.
3. **Visual Density (UX):** The balance of information and screen real estate. High density (smaller fonts/padding) feels more "pro" and efficient, while low density (larger elements) is more accessible but can feel bloated.
4. **Typography Scaling:** Using mathematical relationships (like the Minor Third or Perfect Fourth) to define font sizes ensures hierarchy without overwhelming the eye.
5. **Prompt Engineering:** Structuring requests to force specific formats (JSON) and trust signals (Ratings).
6. **Stateless UI:** The app functions entirely in the browser, relying on LocalStorage for persistence.

## Design Philosophy
- **Speed over Fluff:** Fast interactions and quick responses.
- **Micro-Copy:** Using "black" (900) weights and tracking (letter spacing) to make tiny text readable and stylish.
- **Action-Oriented:** Every generated card should lead to a direct action (Booking, Sharing, or Mapping).
